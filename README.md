# pedl_kaggle_connectx
Project for my Deep Learning training.

Using different Reinforcement Learning algorithms (including Deep Reinforcement Learning ones), and the environment with 2 agents designed by Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/connectx/), we have trained several agents to learn how to play ConnectX just using their interactions with the environment.
The project has been developed in Python using NumPy, Keras and Tensorflow.
